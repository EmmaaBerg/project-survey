# Survey form with React

The project for this week was to create a typeform like product in React and practice state hook and controlled forms. 

## The problem

I started by making a basic page with all the form elements I wanted to display. Then I divided it up to different components, one for each step of the survey (question one is one component etc). After that I tried to connect everything and making it more dynamic. 

My main problem with this project was to understand how to connect and use state hook. I spend most of my time trying to understand that part better, so if I had more time I would have used some other form-elements than just  dropdown and radio buttons. But for now it felt more important to try to get the basic of React and state hook.
